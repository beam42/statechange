<w2> Structurally, California’s government is very similar to the U.S. Government. The Constitution of California lays out <b>three co-equal branches:</b> </w2>

<w2> We'll focuse on the state legislative branch, because it was built for mass participation in a way that the other branches (especially the judicial branch!) were not.  <br></w2>

  <w2> <b>Shape of the legislature:</b><br>
California’s legislative branch, like the US Congress, has an upper house and a lower house. The upper house is called the State Senate, and its members are called Senators. The lower house is called the Assembly, and members are called Assemblymembers. 

<br><br>

Today there are 40 Senators and 80 Assemblymembers in California: they represent around one million and half a million Californians respectively. Together, they spend most of the year working in Sacramento to pass laws that affect the entire state.

<br><br>
  <w2> <b>Legislation:</b><br>
Any senator or assemblymember may introduce a bill to change or establish the law. Bills must pass smaller committees made up of a few legislators before they can be put to a vote before an entire chamber. If a bill passes its committee and then survives a vote by all members in one chamber, it must then begin the process again in the other. Exactly the same way it's done at the federal level!
<br><br>
If a bill passes both houses, it goes to the Governor’s desk, and the Governor, like the President, may either sign the bill into law or veto it. <br><br>

  <w2> <b>Other duties of state representatives:
</b><br>
Typically, state lawmakers have two types of office: one capitol office and several district offices. <br><br>
The capitol office is located in Sacramento, the state capital. This is where most of the law-writing and voting actually goes on, so these offices serve as a sort of home base for the representative’s legislative staff. 
<br><br>
Depending on the geographical size of their district, a representative may also have several district offices. These are their interface with the people they represent: they hold meetings with constituents here, and the district office staff tends to be less involved in the crafting of legislation, and more focused on keeping a representative in the loop on things back home.

<w2> <b>The Executive:
</b><br>
Governors are typically considered the executives of their respective states, like mini-Presidents. This is mostly accurate, especially when it comes to legislation (see above), and things like nominating justices to the State Supreme Court. However, California’s governor must share their power with seven other elected executives, each with their own lanes. These are:
 <br><br>
 Lieutenant Governor: Kind of like the Vice President, largely ceremonial, but steps into power if the Governor is incapacitated. Because they are elected separately, they may be from an opposing political party.
 <br><br>
 Attorney General: The state’s first lawyer, usually considered the second most powerful office in California after the Governor, and a frequent springboard to higher office.
  <br><br>
  There is also a Secretary of State, in charge of elections; a State Treasurer; a State Controller (which is like a treasurer but with a few key differences); a Superintendent of Public Instruction, who oversees educational matters; and an Insurance Commissioner. Most states don’t have so many elected executives, the Insurance Commissioner thing is especially unusual.
